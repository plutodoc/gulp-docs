# What is gulp?

**A toolkit to automate & enhance your workflow**

Leverage gulp and the flexibility of JavaScript to automate slow, repetitive workflows and compose them into efficient build pipelines.

## Flexible

Using code over configuration, utilize all of JavaScript to create your gulpfile—where tasks can be written using your own code or chained single purpose plugins.

## Composable

Write individual, focused tasks and compose them into larger operations, providing you with speed and accuracy while reducing repetition.

## Efficient

By using gulp streams, you can apply many transformations to your files while in memory before anything is written to the disk—significantly speeding up your build process.
