# Intro

**gulp** is an open-source JavaScript toolkit, used as a streaming build system (similar to a more package-focused Make) in front-end web development.

It is a task runner built on Node.js and npm, used for automation of time-consuming and repetitive tasks involved in web development like minification, concatenation, cache busting, unit testing, linting, optimization, etc.

gulp uses a code-over-configuration approach to define its tasks and relies on its small, single-purpose plugins to carry them out. The gulp ecosystem includes more than 3500 such plugins.
